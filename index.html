            <p>
            This week we went over 2 presentations. One of them was about Saftey in the classroom. The second one was about the engineering process. The engineering prcoess presentation taught me how engineering work/the steps of it.
            Another thing we did was a challenge where we got a marble into a cup using pipes. The challenge was fun and actually challenging. It was difficult to coordinate ourselfs at first but got better as we went along and finally we got the marble in the cup.
            This weekend will be fun, it was my birthday on the 24th and I'm gonna celebrate it on Saturday with my family.
