                  <li>Answer to question 3</li>
                  <li>The heaviest part of my bridge was probally the center. This is because I put extra supports in the middle that might not have been necessary and there was more glue in the middle.</li>
                  <li>The design of my bridge came from prior knowledge and quick research from looking at images on google. My group discussed between 2 similar bridge designs and ended up with a sort of combination.</li>
                  <li>My design did not work as intended. I think the bridge broke far too early and it was very unexpected.</li>
                  <li>The point of failiure of my bridge were the ends of my bridge. This was expected since they were just a small peice of the bridge that were actually on the edge of the tables. They didn't have alot of support which was because my bridge broke so we have to use a shorter version of it.</li>
                  <li>My bridge could have been improved by thickening the spaghetti peices by doubling them. Another part we could improve is trying to make both sides of the bridge more even but it would be really difficult to do.</li>

                This week we learned about chemical engineering and we started working on our car projects. Learning about chemical engineering wasn't as interesting as the other fields of engineering but I did learn about what they did. I didnt know how important they were in the oil industry. For my car project I chose to make a arduino car because I thought it was more interesting.
                I want to learn how to code the car because it looks fun and I might buy and build one myself for fun.

                We started working on our car projects this week and so far we have just been CADing and planning how we are building our cars. Since I am making the arduino car, I have to CAD the circuit which has been difficult. Next week, I need to start designing how my car will look like but I think it will probaly be pretty basic with the motors in the back and have a short wheel base to make it nimble.

                Last week I worked on my arduino car project. I was working on the wiring of my car and looking to finalize that this week. I got everything connected and just have to check it. I also connected the motors after having to solder the wires on. I also finished coding but I havent been able to test it yet. My goal for this week is to get my wiring finalized and test my controls to see if bluetooth works. Over the weeknd I got a new LEGO set, the Speed Champions Mercedes set.

                This week I worked alittle bit on my code but abandoned it for later. I started working on the actual car part and put my breadboard, arduino, and battery on cardboard. I just need to put on the wheels and motors now then I will go back to coding. I decided to do my code later because it was more complicated and I can dumb it down if it doesnt end of working. Other then getting my code to actually work, I dont think there is much else I can do to improve my car.

                My car was a regular RC car that was suppose to be controlled from bluetooth by my phone but I wasn't able to do that so I just used a wired control. During the test, it didn't work very well. I had to change the connections of some wires prior to testing which created some unexpected errors that I could fix. Sometimes the wheels had trouble moving because of lack of torque. The car didn't turn very well, this was because of my cars overall design and my wheels were 
                starting to come off. If I were to redo the car I would make a two wheel design that would make turning way easier.

                Our new project is a egg drop. We will drop an egg from 3 stories and our goal is to prevent it from shattering. To do this we are given different materials to build something to do this. We will frist CAD the design, make a BOM, then actually build it. My teams approach is to put the egg in a cone coushined with cotton balls with balloons on the bottom of the cone and a parachute made from a trashbag. I think that our device is coushined enough so that our egg wont shatter.
                What I'm scared of is our device falling the wrong way. The weakest part of our design is the parachute because I don't think it will help slow down the drop but it might help to keep our device falling straight down.

                My egg drop was successful. It survived the drop but it cracked when we tried to take it out. The device didn't work perfectly though. The parachute didn't work great and it landed upsided down. Based on how it fell I'm surprised our egg didn't crack.

                For spring break I think I'm going to Palm Springs. I will probaly go out with my friends also but we haven't decieded anything yet.

                We started a new project where we are making a boat that can travel in a gutter as fast as it can. We are aporaching this problem by creating a rubberband powered paddle to paddle our boat. I expect that our boat atleast gets a good initial launch and speed. Hopefully it can paddle the whole length and not stop early.

                Spring break was pretty boring for me but the best part was having some family friends over at my house and having barbeque together. For the remaining weeks of school I'm just trying to have fun at school while keeping my grades up.

                Over the past 2 week we have been working a gutter boat. Its goal is to go as far and as fast possible. My boat didn't do well, we tried to make a regular shaped boat with a rubberband powered paddle. I think our concept was good but the execution wasn't. We needed to make the boat lighter, lower, and to have bigger paddles

                My favorite parts of the class were challenge days. I like them because they were fun and they weren't big projects. My favorite challenges were the paper boat and figuring out whether there were more wheels or doors. My least favorite part of the class were the presentations of different types of engineering because they were the most boring thing we did in class.
                I don't have any plans for the weekend right now. Maybe I'll go out with friends idk.

                Last week we started a project where we have to make a cardboard boat that 2 people can actually sit and and travel across a pool. Im excited it start building the boat, if I'm confident enough in my boat I will be excited to actually go in it.
                Last week we also had a challenge where we had to build a bridge using only sticky notes. We did pretty well but looking back I could have done much better and used the sticky notes much more efficently. Coming up to the end of the year I'm just looking foward to summer, now that me and my friends have our drivers licenses, we can do so much more.

                Last week and this week we continued working on our boat. Last week we finished the CAD of our boat and this week we started building the boat. We built the floor and sides of the boat. Now we need to make the front and back then put it all together. One challenge I think we will face is using and rationing the tape well. I'm exicted the get the boat built together and more excited to actually test it.
                I dont think I've ever faced any serious stererotypes that I had to overcome. The only thing I had to fight was the stereotype of Armenians have a Mercedes or BMW, I want a lexus.

                Over the last week we have been able to pretty much finish our boat. We built all our walls and main peices and put it all together. All of the joints/connection points are well taped, we also made paddels and added some extra stuff. We still have a decent amount of tape left so this week we will try to find weak points of our boat to fix and maybe add some extra stuff. We might just go over some taped areas extra times just to make sure or add cosmetic stuff.
                The only thing that I'm concerned about is when we actually try our boat, paddeling it will be pretty hard. Orange juice is better then apple juice, I dont have a stron opinion.

                Our boat is done. Last week we just used used our extra tape and put it where ever we thought needed extra tape. We just need to finish our boat report. I didn't do much to celebrate mothers day. My dad,brother, and I got my mom a gift and has a nice dinner.
