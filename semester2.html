                  <li>Answer to question 3</li>
                  <li>The heaviest part of my bridge was probally the center. This is because I put extra supports in the middle that might not have been necessary and there was more glue in the middle.</li>
                  <li>The design of my bridge came from prior knowledge and quick research from looking at images on google. My group discussed between 2 similar bridge designs and ended up with a sort of combination.</li>
                  <li>My design did not work as intended. I think the bridge broke far too early and it was very unexpected.</li>
                  <li>The point of failiure of my bridge were the ends of my bridge. This was expected since they were just a small peice of the bridge that were actually on the edge of the tables. They didn't have alot of support which was because my bridge broke so we have to use a shorter version of it.</li>
                  <li>My bridge could have been improved by thickening the spaghetti peices by doubling them. Another part we could improve is trying to make both sides of the bridge more even but it would be really difficult to do.</li>

                This week we learned about chemical engineering and we started working on our car projects. Learning about chemical engineering wasn't as interesting as the other fields of engineering but I did learn about what they did. I didnt know how important they were in the oil industry. For my car project I chose to make a arduino car because I thought it was more interesting.
                I want to learn how to code the car because it looks fun and I might buy and build one myself for fun.

                We started working on our car projects this week and so far we have just been CADing and planning how we are building our cars. Since I am making the arduino car, I have to CAD the circuit which has been difficult. I need to start designing how my car will look like but I think it will probaly be pretty basic with the motors in the back and have a short wheel base to make it nimble.
